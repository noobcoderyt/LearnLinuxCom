            In this article you are going to learn about how to game on Linux. You might have heard that gaming on Linux
            is trash. It is definitely not true and infact you can play almost all games which you can on Windows. First
            of all, lets talk about native games.

            Playing native games on Linux is probably the easiest. There are two main ways to play native games on
            Linux. First, if the game you want to play is on a website like itch.io, you can just download the
            tar(compressed) file. Extract it and make the the game file executable with the command 'sudo chmod +x
            filename'. Then just double-click on the file to run the game. Second, if your game is on steam and is
            native to Linux, you can simply just download and play it.

            Playing non-native games on Linux is a bit harder than playing native games because you have to use tools
            like wine, proton or lutris for the game. First of all lets talk about steam. If your game is on steam and
            is not native to Linux, just go to the settings option on top-left corner and choose compatibility. Enable
            steam play and select proton. Proton allows you to play windows games on Linux with an ease. You try to open
            your game again, it might take some time in the starting but eventually it will start and you can enjoy. If
            the game you want to play is not on steam, you first have to download the exe of the game online. Then you
            need to install wine on your system. Wine is a bit slow for big games but if your game is small then you can
            use wine. After installing wine just go to the exe location and run 'wine filename'. If you get errors look
            for it on forums.
