            In this article you are going to learn all you need to know about desktop environments on Linux. So what is
            a desktop environment? A desktop environment decides how your desktop and gui looks. There are many
            different desktop environments on Linux. The one which comes pre-installed with Linux Mint is the Cinnamon
            desktop environment which is similar to window's GUI.

            Some of the popular desktop environments are :-
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>KDE Plasma</li>
            <li>Xfce</li>
            <li>GNOME</li>
            <li>Mate</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

            KDE Plasma is a desktop environment which is both fast and good-looking. If you want a desktop environment
            which looks good and is as well as fast, go with KDE Plasma.
        </p>
        <p>
            Xfce is the most lightweight desktop environment. If you have a low-end machine, xfce might be the best
            option for you. Xfce doesn't look great by default, but you can customize it and make it look very great. As
            you can see the image below.

        <p>
            GNOME is a popular desktop environment known for its looks. By default, it is one of the best looking
            desktop environments. But when there is an advantage, there is also a disadvantage. It uses resources very
            much which can be a problem if you do not have a decent machine. If you have a good machine then you can
            definitely go with GNOME, but if you do not have then it might be slow for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mate Desktop Environment is a user-friendly and lightweight desktop environment for Linux and Unix-like
            operating systems. It is a fork of the GNOME 2 desktop environment, which was discontinued in favor of GNOME
            3. If you want a user-friendly experience with customization then you can go with Mate.

        <p>
            Now when you know the basics of desktop environments, you are ready to switch one if you want. To install
            KDE Plasma on Linux Mint, first of all you need to update and upgrade your system. After your system has
            been upgraded, simply execute the command 'sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop'. After it is installed,
            restart your computer and at the login screen, click on the settings button and choose KDE Plasma.
